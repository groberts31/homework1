            <p>Hello, My name is Gregory Roberts. Born in Barstow, CA and 
            raised in Charlotte, NC since the age of 3. I am a graduate
            of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.
            I majored in Business Finance while also using up my college 
            free time playing basketball on the Mens School Team.</p>
    
            <p>Just to tell you a little bit more about myself, I am a father of 4. 
            Two boys and two girls. I also have a fiance that has been working
            my nerves about this wedding since the day I proposed, making me 
            rethink this whole marriage thing. Just kidding. I am currently employed with 
            Wells Fargo Bank as a Financial Crimes Specialist. I been with the 
            bank for more than 7 yrs and believe it is now time for a change to 
            something more interesting and self satisfying which led me to 
            Computer Coding. I hope to make the best of the opportunity. Thanks for 
            visiting my page. Feel free to take a look around.</p>
